# Choice Makr

React Native project that helps users make a random decision from a list of choices they input. This is a project I put together as I've been learning React Native. I made this before being introduced to [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), so the screen changes in this application are based on state.

## Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

## Installation

Feel free to play around with the code!

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/melvincayas/choice-makr.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```

3. Ensure your machine has [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (iOS) and/or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Android) for mobile device emulation.

Or if you want to run the application on your own mobile device:

4. Download [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile device and scan the QR code that shows after running:

```
npm start
```

## Further Implementations

My goal with this project was to build a small and simple application with React Native to reinforce my learning. To further expand on this project I would:

- Update the UI on smaller devices with [Dimensions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/dimensions)
- Add landscape orientation
