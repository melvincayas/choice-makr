# Choice Makr

React Native project that helps users make a random decision from a list of choices they input. This is a project I put together as I've been learning React Native. I made this before being introduced to [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), so the screen changes in this application are based on state.

## Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
